Yesterday evening, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) voted to include anti-Palestinian racism <https://www.cjpme.org/pr_2024_06_20_tdsb> (APR) as part of its Combating Hate and Racism strategy! This means that the TDSB has committed to developing resources to inform students about APR, alongside other forms of discrimination including Islamophobia and antisemitism.\n\nThis is a major victory and is a result of important advocacy work by Toronto Palestinian families <https://torontopalestinianfamilies.ca/>, Toronto Jewish families <https://torontojewishfamilies.wordpress.com/>, and others. Acknowledging APR is critically important amid the skyrocketing incidents of violence and hate against Palestinians and their supporters. Unfortunately, pro-Israel organizations continue to oppose any mention of APR and are actively campaigning to have this decision reversed.\n\nDon't allow political pressure from pro-Israel groups erase Palestinian voices! Please click here to send a message to TDSB Trustees, the Ontario Education Minister, and other public officials. <https://www.cjpme.org/tdsb_apr_policy> Please join us in thanking the TDSB for their principled decision to address APR as part of its broader fight against all forms of racism\n\n<https://www.cjpmecontent.org/tdsb_apr_policy>\n\nPlease share this campaign:\n\n- Click here <https://nmshr.io/s/twitter/ZBE8BTXEHQ==/b> to Tweet, or retweet <https://x.com/CJPME/status/1803871768836260032> our campaign tweet\n- Click here <https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=870748418430704&set=a.482363290602554> like and share our Facebook campaign post\n- Click here <https://www.instagram.com/p/C8cvLJ5Te2b/> to like our main Instagram post\n- Forward <https://nmshr.io/s/email/ZBE8BTXEHQ==/b> this email to your friends\n\nMore Info\n\nA report <https://pub-tdsb.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=17569> adopted yesterday by the TDSB in a 15-7 vote <https://www.youtube.com/live/SVb3KShPlaM?feature=shared&t=21207> includes anti-Palestinian racism (APR) as an area of focus “in response to student and community voices,” and follows advocacy from Toronto Palestinian and Jewish families. This means that a working group will be formed to educate students on APR, alongside other forms of discrimination including Islamophobia and antisemitism.\n\nA working description of anti-Palestinian racism was first developed by the Arab-Canadian Lawyers Association (ACLA) in its 2022 report titled “Anti-Palestinian Racism: Naming, Framing and Manifestations <https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61db30d12e169a5c45950345/t/627dcf83fa17ad41ff217964/1652412292220/Anti-Palestinian+Racism-+Naming%2C+Framing+and+Manifestations.pdf>.” The ACLA describes APR as “a form of anti-Arab racism that silences, excludes, erases, stereotypes, defames or dehumanizes Palestinians or their narratives,” and identifies various forms of APR, including “denying the Nakba and justifying violence against Palestinians,” “failing to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people with a collective identity,” and “defaming Palestinians and their allies with slander such as being inherently antisemitic, a terrorist threat/sympathizer or opposed to democratic values.\n\nThe need to adopt APR as part of anti-racism strategies around Canada is corroborated by the rise of violence and discrimination against Canadian Palestinians and their allies. Some recent examples of hateful acts include: An arson attack <https://london.ctvnews.ca/next-level-kind-of-hate-alleged-hate-driven-arson-concerning-for-muslims-and-police-1.6920908> on a London family in response to their lawn signs expressing support of Palestinian human rights; a mobile advertising truck <https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-anti-muslim-islamophobic-truck-advertising-1.7240534> in Toronto demonizing Muslims and Palestinians while claiming that Canada is “under siege”; beheading threats <https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/2024/06/19/winnipeg-man-says-he-believes-hes-receiving-increasing-threats-due-to-public-support-of-palestinian-community/> received by the leader of the Canadian Palestinian Association of Manitoba; and a covert foreign influence campaign <https://www.cjpme.org/pr_2024_06_05_foreign_influence> by the Israeli government spreading anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim messages. While the APR preceded October 7, 2023, it has been on the rise within Canadian society and institutions.\n\nMany pro-Israeli lobby groups in Canada have attacked the TDSB for this policy, and the Centre of Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) even ludicrously claimed <https://www.cija.ca/tdsb_trustees_must_vote_no_chr_ignores_antisemitism> that simply recognizing anti-Palestinian racism would “result in the censorship of core aspects of Jewish identity.” Such false claims imply that anti-racism work is exclusive and a zero-sum game, and that it needs to benefit one group at the expense of another. Acknowledging anti-Palestinian hatred is a necessary part of combatting all forms of discrimination, including antisemitism, in an intersectional manner. Join us in applauding the TDSB’s decision in the hope that additional school boards, the federal government and other public bodies will follow the TDSB and incorporate APR into their anti-racism strategies <https://www.cjpme.org/tdsb_apr_policy>.\n\nThank you!\n\nIf you believe in what CJPME is doing to influence the media, politicians and the public, please consider making a gift of financial support <https://www.cjpme.org/donate_ep> to CJPME. Our work depends entirely on private donations. Monthly donations <https://www.cjpme.org/donate_monthly> are especially helpful, as they sustain our ongoing work and make it easier for us to strategize for the future.

Every additional voice makes a difference!\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nTom, Michael, Jason, Lynn, Alex, Fatima, Rose, Wissam, and the rest of the CJPME team",

Unlike many of our colleagues in Congress, Jamaal hasn’t bowed down to those who believe killing thousands of Palestinian children is acceptable.\n\nBecause Jamaal believed that Palestinians deserve to live, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent nearly $20 million to unseat him.\n\nThis is the most expensive U.S. House of Representatives primary ever. Funded mainly by far-right billionaires, AIPAC saturated the airwaves with racist attack ads and encouraged Republicans to register as Democrats to vote against Jamaal.\n\nWe can’t let AIPAC undermine our democracy or scare lawmakers into continued unconditional support for Israel’s military. So we’ve got to defend AIPAC’s next target: Rep. Cori Bush.\n\nLike Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush is a courageous leader for Palestinians’ human rights. AIPAC has already spent $2 million supporting Cori’s anti-ceasefire opponent, and the group will spend many millions more over the next month before Cori’s August 6th primary election in Missouri.\n\nCan you help Cori Bush overcome millions of dollars in attacks from pro-genocide billionaires? Please rush an urgent donation to our re-election campaigns today.\n\nRUSH A DONATION\n\nBack in October of last year, Cori heeded the call from the grassroots to introduce a Congressional resolution demanding a ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza. Like Jamaal, Cori was one of the first members of Congress to correctly refer to these attacks on Palestinians as ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nIn 2014 Cori met Palestinian activists on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri while protesting for Black lives, and she saw the connections between Black and Palestinian struggles against state violence. Since then, she’s criticized the U.S. government’s complicity in Israel’s human rights abuses.",
